An angry dog will try to make themselves look as large and threatening as possible, with a stiff, upright body, hard and unblinking eyes and flattened ears. It’s common for their fur to stand on end as well.

Their mouth will be open with and their lips will be tense and drawn back, with their muzzle and nose wrinkled as they bare their teeth. Their weight will be forward over their front legs ready to lunge or attack, and they will either be silent or perhaps making a low threatening growl – a truly angry dog doesn't usually shout about it!

Avoid provoking your dog if they’re angry. Don't stare or shout at them or make any sudden movements, but give them time and space to calm down.
