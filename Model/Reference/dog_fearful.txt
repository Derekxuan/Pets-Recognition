If your dog is fearful their body language will make it quite obvious; this type of dog expression can be very dramatic. Different dogs have different fear responses: some will cower to make themselves look small, some will roll on their back to show appeasement in a social conflict, some simply stand very still and others will bark loudly or growl defensively.

Their eyes may be wide open, darting backwards and forwards, and either staring and hard or squinting and taking sideways glances at whatever object or person it is they’re afraid of. Their ears will be flattened against their head, and their lips will be tense. They might lick their lips or yawn, and their tail will be still, low or tucked between their legs. They will usually be so focused on the threat that they even refuse their favourite treat!

A dog’s main goal when they feel fearful is to simply survive the perceived threat, so their body language, facial expressions and appetite will only go back to normal when they feel safe again.
