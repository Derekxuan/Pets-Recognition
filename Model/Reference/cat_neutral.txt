If lying down, they could be stretched out, curled up into a ball, or lying on their front with paws neatly tucked underneath them.

Their eyes might be blinking softly, or half closed.

Their ears will be relaxed, held casually upright and forward â€“ although they could swivel around independently if your cat is listening to things around them.

Their whiskers will be relaxed, away from the sides of their face, and they may almost appear to smile!

Their body is nice and relaxed, with no tension to suggest they might be about to spring into action.
