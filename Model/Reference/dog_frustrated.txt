Dogs can feel different types of frustration, from longer-term depressed (such as the dog in this picture), to a more active, immediate frustration, usually in response to a specific event (such as not being given something they want). They can also feel frustrated if they’re not able to get away from something unpleasant.

When it comes to dog body language, a frustrated dog is usually tense and stiff-legged. They might bark or lunge at the object of their frustration, or try to run away from it. They will be totally focused on the source and probably won’t listen or respond to any of your attempts to distract them.

Their eyes will be wide and unblinking, their ears pricked and if they aren’t barking, their lips will be stiff.

This is a very tense state and dogs can’t maintain it forever, so they may eventually resign themselves to the frustrating situation, although sometimes they might end up becoming depressed. This can be misinterpreted as calm acceptance so your dog needs lots of careful, loving attention to help them relax after they’ve been frustrated, before they will behave normally again.
