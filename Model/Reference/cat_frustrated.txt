An actively frustrated cat usually focuses intently on their object of frustration, and will try everything they can do to get what they want!

All their senses are tuned onto their goal – eyes will be wide open with pupils dilated, ears forward, and whiskers forward-pointing and spread.

They may pace impatiently if they can’t get to what they want.

Cats can’t maintain this frustration forever, so if they can’t get what they want, they will either give up, or in some cases enter into a longer-term frustration or even depression, depending on the source of their frustration.

Cats with longer-term depression may often be lethargic, off their food and won’t want to play or interact with others.
