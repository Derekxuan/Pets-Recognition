cat_angry


An angry cat will be rigid, with tail held out stiff and straight or curled around and under their body.

They will act very differently from usual – they could be silent, hissing, spitting or growling.

They will try to look large and threatening, with fur erect, stiff front legs, or crouching in a threatening manner.

Their ears will be tense, and flat back against their head, and whiskers will be stiff away from their face.

Their eyes will be hard and focussed. Their pupils may be narrowed, although some cats might have round, unblinking eyes.
