Happiness is one of the easiest dog emotions to spot, and it’s definitely a favourite expression for your furry family friend! Your dog’s eyes are gentle and in soft-focus, with a relaxed forehead and their ears are floppy if they’re running, or moving backwards and forwards in an engaging, friendly manner.

Dogs can’t actually smile, but some, like this Golden Retriever, do appear to grin! Their lips are loose, their mouth slightly open and their tongue will probably poke out as they pant evenly and gently.

A dog’s tail is a great indicator of their mood – a waggy tail usually means a happy dog! If they’re wagging their tail so vigorously it seems that their entire back legs are shaking then it means they’re very happy indeed!

A happy dog moves in a relaxed, easy way, and will encourage you to play and share their happiness.
