An anxious dog's eyes can be wide and staring or they may sometimes narrow them and avoid eye-contact. You might see wrinkling or tension on their forehead, and their ears, if pricked, will be held slightly back as they move them around to try to gather clues about possible danger. If they have long, swinging ears (also known as ‘pendulous’ ears), they may be held closer to their head than usual.

Their mouth will usually be closed but, if it’s open, their lips will be tense and they may lick them and yawn nervously, even though you know they aren’t hungry or tired.

Their body and tail are probably still and in a slightly lowered posture. Anxious dogs sometimes wag their tails cautiously, but this is done as a gesture of appeasement rather than because they’re happy. This is why anxiety can sometimes go unrecognised, so keep a close eye on them if they’re in a new or challenging situation.
