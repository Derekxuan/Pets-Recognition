Your cat's eyes will be open and not blinking, with pupils dilated into an oval or circle.

Their ears might move from their relaxed forward position to scan for more information, swivelling around independently from each other. If they are very anxious, they may even flatten back to their head.

Their head will begin to lower, with whiskers pulled back to the side to appear small and non-threatening – or even be swept forward on alert.

As anxiety increases, your cat might start to cower, or their back might arch to prepare to run.

Cat tail language is very important here – their tail might be still or moving slowly side to side at the tip, which is a sign of anxiety. If you see this distinctive cat tail sign, make sure to offer some reassurance.
