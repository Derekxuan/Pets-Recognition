cat_fearful

Your cat’s ears will be flattened back against their head, which might be lowered with gaze angled upwards.
They may run away, or stand or crouch very still if this isn’t possible.
Their eyes will be open very wide, with pupils fully dilated and whiskers flattened or bristling.
They may hiss or spit at close threats, growl or strike with claws out.
Some cats will straighten their front legs to make themselves look taller, or arch their backs and fluff themselves up to look bigger.
Their tail may be held under their body, or be slashing vigorously from side to side.
