if they’re lying down they'll be relaxed and still, but ready to perk up and take an interest in what you’re doing.

Their eyes are soft and relaxed, moving smoothly and showing no white parts as they scan their surroundings from their comfortable resting spot. Their ears are also relaxed as they casually listen to their environment, and their forehead and eyebrows are smooth and free from tension. Their mouth may be either closed or else slightly open, and while they won't be showing their ‘ready-for-fun' partial grin, their lips and muzzle will be relaxed. They are perfectly content!
