## Run on Flask 
For runing the back-end server:

  `cd ~/Web/FlaskServer`

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  `export FLASK_APP=app.py`

  `flask run --host=0.0.0.0`

Then you can visit the website on your localhost and the port is 5000. But run on this way, only one user can access the website simultaneously.

## Run on Gunicorn
Using Gunicorn to run the server:

  `cd ~/Web/FlaskServer`

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  `gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:5000 -t 60 app:app`

Then you can visit the website on your localhost and the port is 5000. On this way, the website can be visited by multiple users simultaneously.

## Run using docker 
Docker can run the server in a container which contains alll needed enviroment. With docker installed, you need to follow the bolow command: 

 `sudo docker pull codegod/my_flask_server:v2`

 `sudo docker run -p 5000:5000 --name petSmile -i -t codegod/my_flask_server:v2 /bin/bash`

Then, you can follow the above examples to run the server inside the container on Flask or Gunicorn without the install requirements.txt step.

## Research Cloud
