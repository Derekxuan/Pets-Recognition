## Run on Gunicorn
Using Gunicorn to run the server:

  `cd ~/Web/FlaskServer`

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  `export FLASK_APP=app.py`

  `gunicorn -b 127.0.0.1:4000 app:app`

Then you can visit the website on your localhost and the port is 5000. On this way, the website can be visited by multiple users simultaneously.

## Run using docker 
Docker can run the server in a container which contains alll needed enviroment. With docker installed, you need to follow the bolow command: 

 `sudo docker pull codegod/my_flask_server`

 `sudo docker run --name give_container_a_name -d -p 5000:5000 codegod/my_flask_server`

Then, you can follow the above examples to run the server inside the container on Flask or Gunicorn without the install requirements.txt step.
