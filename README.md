## Web
The web directory contains the website's front-end and back-end. For runing the back-end server 

  `cd ~/Web/FlaskServer`

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`

  `export FLASK_APP=app.py`

  `flask run --host=0.0.0.0:5000`

Then you can visit the website on your localhost and the port is 5000.

## Andorid
